# jesus_bloodline
Adds a bloodline of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.

I started making this mod last year, but eventually completely forgot about it. I found it
while cleaning up my files and added in a little last thing to actually make it have any use
whatsoever since a bloodline to someone who is dead wouldn't be worth much I guess.

Full Features:
- Adds character Jesus with nickname Christ in Dynasty of Nazareth;
- Adds Bloodline Holy Blood of the Savior;
- Any characters that are catholic & have zealous trait get the bloodline on startup.

Notes: Jesus's culture is Ashkenazi. I have a vague memory of doing some quick research of Jesus' cutlure and I bumped into a couple of articles stating this. If anyone would provide a better source, please let me know.
